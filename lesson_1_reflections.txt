hello what you doing?
i am knowing git
what is it actually
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
